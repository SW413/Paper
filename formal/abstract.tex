This paper presents the considerations and implementations done during the development of \gls{gamble}.
\gls{gamble} is a math-oriented language specifically focusing upon utilising the \acrshort{gpu} for decreasing the runtime of matrix operations.

During development the language have been defined, designed and implemented.
The design and implementation involves developing a multi-pass compiler.
The design as well as implementation process entails considering the structure of the compiler, as well as the considerations one must do for each process.
The compiler consists of a scanner, parser, scope checker, type checker and a code generation process.

To help the programmer using the compiler, an error handling system has been developed which provides both errors and warnings to the user.
Furthermore a makefile is designed which uses the Gnu Compiler Collection compiler to compile the output of the \gls{gamble} compiler, which is written in OpenCL C.
All of the \gls{gamble} compiler components are built in Java, this means that all development platforms supporting Java Virtual Machine can run the compiler.
