This paper presents the considerations and implementations done during the development of \gls{gamble}.
\gls{gamble} is a math-oriented language specifically focusing upon utilising the \acrshort{gpu} for decreasing the runtime of matrix operations.

The \acrshort{cfg} of the \gls{gamble} has been defined and used to design and implement a compiler for the language.
The design as well as implementation process entails considering the structure of the compiler, as well as the considerations one must do for each process.
The compiler consists of three phases: Syntax Analysis, Contextual Analysis and Code Generation.

To help the programmer using the compiler, an error handling system has been developed which provides both errors and warnings to the user.
\gls{gamble} proved to be fast at computing certain operations on matrices and vectors using the parallel computing platform OpenCL to access the \acrshort{gpu}, compared to running sequential executed C code.
