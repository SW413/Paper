\chapter{Compiler Overview}
A compiler can be separated into three phases; syntax analysis, contextual analysis and code generation.
The syntax analysis phase checks whether or not the source code adheres to the rules for the language, such as statement constructs.
The contextual analysis phase checks whether or not the language is used correctly, such as type checking.
The code generation translates the source code into the target code once the syntax and contextual analysis phases have accepted the source code.
This chapter examines each phase of the compiler and what these entail.
How each phase is constructed for GAMBLE will also be gone over in this chapter. %This may or may not change

\chapter{Syntax Analysis}
Syntax analysis is the first phase in compiling a language.
In this phase it is checked whether the input adheres to the rules of the language.
These rules are defined in a languages' \acrshort{cfg}.
The \acrshort{cfg} of \gls{gamble} is further described in \myref{sec:cfg} .
This analysis can be split up into to further sub phases, lexical analysis and parsing, these are described in this chapter.

\section{Scope Checking}
As a part of the contextual analysis the compiler must ensure that every reference is valid in their given scope.
The validity of such reference is specific to the rules of the language, this section describes how the compiler upholds the rules listed in \myref{subsec:Scope}.
