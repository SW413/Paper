\chapter{Compiler Overview}
%A compiler can be separated into three phases; syntax analysis, contextual analysis and code generation.
%The syntax analysis phase checks whether or not the source code adheres to the rules for the language, such as statement constructs.
%The contextual analysis phase checks whether or not the language is used correctly, such as type checking.
%The code generation translates the source code into the target code once the syntax and contextual analysis phases have accepted the source code.
%This chapter examines each phase of the compiler and what these entail.
%How each phase is constructed for GAMBLE will also be gone over in this chapter. %This may or may not change

The compiler for \gls{gamble} is separated into three phases: syntax analysis, contextual analysis and code generation.
The first two of which are sometimes known as the front end of the compiler, it transformes the source code into an intermediate representation, and verifies its correctness. \todo{Er ikke 100\% sikker på at alt verifikation sker her.}

In the syntax analysis phase the input source code is transformed to an \acrfull{ast}. 
First ANTLR is used to parse the source code, and generate a parse tree.
From the parse tree a \acrshort{ast} is generated, it must contain the same information however it is simplified. 

In the contextual analysis phase the \acrshort{ast} is used to generate a symbol table, this is again used for checking scopes and types. 
The result of this is transforming the \acrshort{ast} into a decorated \acrshort{ast}, meaning that it has more information and/or is simplified. 

In the back end of the compiler optimization and code generation are done.
Optimization is any process which will make the generated program faster, e.g. eliminating unused code. 
In the code generation phase the output code is generated from all the information in the decorated \acrshort{ast} and symbol table.

The target language of this compiler is OpenCL C.
To get this to run on any machine it is necessary to compile the output of the \gls{gamble} compiler, with a compiler for OpenCL C.
This is an abstraction made by the product group to simplify the process of generating code. \todo{Svagt argument? Men sandheden? Måske også fordi at det ikke er lige til at generere gpu code?}
