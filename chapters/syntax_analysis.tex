\chapter{Syntax Analysis}\label{sec:syntaxAnalysis}
Syntax analysis is the first phase in compiling a language.
In this phase it is checked whether the input adheres to the rules of the language.
These rules are defined in a languages' \acrshort{cfg}.
The \acrshort{cfg} of \gls{gamble} is further described in \myref{sec:cfg}.
This analysis can be split up into further sub phases, lexical analysis and parsing, these are described in this chapter.
A diagram of the part of compiler responsibly for the syntax analysis is shown is in \myref{fig:flowSyntax}
