For this project the goal was to create a language and a corresponding compiler which could perform numerical computations on the \acrshort{gpu}.
During the project different aspects of the process of creating a language and a compiler has been presented; different ways of handling these aspects have been discussed as well as the implementation of these.
The language \gls{gamble} was designed to make it easier for programmers and mathematicians alike to perform matrix and vector computations that used the power of the \acrshort{gpu} without the programmer needing to specify so in the source code.
Using the operators, defined in \myref{subsec:operators}, along with matrices or vectors \gls{gamble} will compile to OpenCL C code, which runs the computations on the \acrshort{gpu}.
As a result of running computations on the \acrshort{gpu} an increase in runtime efficiency can be obtained; an increase in runtime efficiency will only exist if the computations are of a significant size; \myref{cha:test_of_language} shows what data size is required for \gls{gamble} to provide an increase in runtime efficiency by using the \acrshort{gpu} over the \acrshort{cpu}.
%This increases computation speed if a reasonably large enough size of the computations are reached, when compared to \gls{gamble} code which is being run on the CPU using ordinary C code instead of OpenCL C.

For developing the compiler the parser generator \acrshort{antlr}4 was used, which made a parser from the grammar specified by the project group.
This parser gives a parse tree as output; The parse tree is translated into an \acrshort{ast} by the compiler.
The \acrshort{ast} removes redundant information from the parse tree thus simplifying its traversal.
The \acrshort{ast} allowed for easier access to the nodes than the parse tree, while grouping information and using less nodes for information compared to the parse tree.
Scope and type checking are essential parts of the compiler and identifies errors in the source code before runtime.

The project showed that there are many aspects in creating a language and a compiler.
The use of the \acrshort{gpu} is worthwhile when the size of the computations become sufficiently large, and creators of new languages or compilers should think of including ways of using this resource for such purposes.
Furthermore it became evident that attempting a general solution for all \acrshort{gpu} platforms is not the best approach, it would be better to spend the proper amount of time developing for each individual platform, if that time is available.
