\section{Types and Variables}\label{sec:Types}
%http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2103809&seqNum=3
\gls{gamble} has three primitive data types; integers (int), floating points (float) and boolean values (bool), as well as two complex data types; matrices and vector. 
In \gls{gamble} most variables must be initialised when declared, the complex datatypes will be filled with zeroes if only the dimensions of the complex type is specified.
This avoids any null references which could otherwise cause runtime errors. 
The first reason for this is that the purpose of the language is to perform arithmetic operations on the \acrshort{gpu}, so by excluding this the language's simplicity increases, and therefore its read- and writability increases.
A second reason being that the size of every variable in \gls{gamble} is unchangeable.
Any vector and matrix will be allocated on the heap. 

\subsection*{Integers and floating points}
The integer datatypes in \gls{gamble} is either a positive or negative integer, represented by the two's complement method. 
Meaning that it ranges from $-(2^{n-1}) $ to $2^{n-1} - 1 $, where n is the number of bits used.
A floating point number is an approximation to a real number. 
It is separated in 3 parts, the sign bit, the mantissa and the exponent. 
Floats in \gls{gamble} are in base 2, the value of a float is calculated by $ {(-1)}^{sign bit} \cdot mantissa \cdot 2^{exponent} $. 
Integers and floating point numbers default to 32 bits with the keywords \texttt{int} and \texttt{float}. 
It is possible to declare 16 and 64 bit integers and floating point numbers by postfixing their size to their respective keywords, e.g. \texttt{float64} or \texttt{int16}.
It is useful to be able to specify the size of an integer or a floating point number, as data transfer can cause a lot of overhead particularly when transferring data to and from the \acrshort{gpu}.
Furthermore small datatypes allow more variables using the same amount of memory as their bigger counterparts.

\subsection*{Boolean}
A boolean value is either true or false. 
These are used for control structures in \gls{gamble} which takes a boolean value as a parameter. 
But can also be used for any means which the programmer finds useful. 

\subsection*{Vectors and Matrices}
A vector in \gls{gamble} is a sequence of entries which are each the same primitive data type. 
A matrix consists of a number of row vectors inside a column vector, each row vector is the same dimension. 
A matrix is initialised with the syntax shown in \myref{lst:matrix}.
As is shown there exists two ways of declaring a matrix and a vector, one can either provide the values for each entry, or one can provide the dimensions required of a matrix or vector in which case all values are initialised as zero.
A matrix entry can be accessed by the syntax shown in \myref{lst:matrix} on the last line.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Syntax for creating a matrix or vector},label={lst:matrix},numbers=none]
//Makes a 2x2 matrix by providing entry values
matrix<int> m = [1, 0; 
                 0, 1];
//Makes a 100x100 matrix with all values set to 0
matrix<int>[100, 100] mm;

//Making a vector by providing values
vector<int> v = [1, 0];
//Makes a vector with 100 entries all set to 0
vector<int>[100] vv;

//a is assigned to the integer in the first column of the first row from matrix m
int a = m[1,1];   
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Operators}\label{subsec:operators}
Available operators for simple data types in the language can be found on \myref{tbl:operators} with a short description.  

%It is not possible to use operators with matrices or vectors, functions which support different operations on these types will be included in a library.
\input{figures/operators.tex}
Some operators will work with vectors and matrices.
Since the elements in vectors and matrices are one of the simple types of \gls{gamble}, the operands on both sides of an infix operator must adhere to the rules of type compatibility.
The list of possible operands on these complex data types can be seen on \myref{tbl:matOps}.
The $+$ and $-$ operations in \myref{tbl:matOps} requires the matrices and vectors to have the same dimensions.
The $*$ operation requires one matrix to have the same row size as the other matrix' column size. Ex. a matrix [j,k] and a matrix [k,h] can be multiplied because they have the same size k.
This will result in a [j,h] sized matrix.
The use of operators between matrix and vector instances is influenced by MATLAB which uses the same concept.
