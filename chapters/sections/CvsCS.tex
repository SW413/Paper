\section{Choice of target language}
In \myref{CUDAvsOpenCL} we chose the target language for the compiler to be OpenCL C.
OpenCL C is very low level so we chose to use a library called Simple OpenCL, which simplifies parts of OpenCL C, such as memory handling and kernel launching at the cost of explicit control. 
However using OpenCL C came at a cost of development time, as there were many nuances which were hard to comprehend and understand. 
Using another target language, which was more high level, could potentially have taken less time, \todo{Kommer vel an på hvor gode bindings til det alternative sprog er? - Marc} which would free up time to implement more language features, suggestions to such features can be found in \myref{cha:future_works}. 

A choice for this new target language could be one of the high level languages discussed in \myref{sec:state_of_the_art} or any high level language with a CUDA or OpenCL implementation. \todo{Man kunne evt. have noget om at den opdelte compiler gør det nemmere at skifte target sproget? -- Troels}
