\section{Reserved Words}

% (fold)
\label{sec:reserved_words}
In \gls{gamble} there exists a number of reserved words used for types and language constructs among others.
These reserved words, also known as language keywords, cannot be used as identifiers in the language. However, keywords are not always reserved words.
This is because keywords such as \texttt{if} and \texttt{for} often are followed by a specific construct.
In fact most cases of keyword usage require some sort of special construct, hereby rendering the keyword unambiguous.
Because of this it is for example possible to use \texttt{if}, along with all other keywords, as identifiers in FORTRAN.\citep{fortran_identifiers}
To simplify the lexing process all keywords can be considered reserved words, hereby minimising the lookahead needed; this is how \gls{gamble} handles keywords.
The reserved words of \gls{gamble} are as follows:
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\def\arraystretch{1.5} \setlength{\tabcolsep}{2em}
	\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
        \texttt{int}     & \texttt{int16}     & \texttt{int32}     & \texttt{int64}     & \texttt{bool}    \\
        \texttt{float}   & \texttt{float16}   & \texttt{float32}   & \texttt{float64}   & \texttt{void}    \\
        \texttt{matrix}  & \texttt{vector}    &                    &                    &                  \\
        \texttt{if}      & \texttt{else}      & \texttt{for}       & \texttt{while}     &                  \\
        \texttt{print}   & \texttt{rows}      & \texttt{cols}      & \texttt{return}    & \texttt{include} \\
    \end{tabular}
	\def\arraystretch{1}
\end{table}

Besides the reserved words \gls{gamble} contains literals, which also cannot be used as identifiers.
The literals in \gls{gamble} are \texttt{true} and \texttt{false}.
If the language were to provide a \texttt{null} value, this would be a literal as well.
