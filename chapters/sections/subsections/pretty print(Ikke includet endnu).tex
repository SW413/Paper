Pretty Print is a application that take a source code in \gls{gamble} as a input, and checks if it is valid compared to the \acrshort{ast}. 
The output should be the same as the output, but indentation in the source file.
With a Pretty Printer it is possible to assure that the \acrshort{ast} is correct.
The output from the Pretty Print is in such a shape that it can be used as a input of the Pretty Printer again.
This is done to make sure the Pretty Printer is working correctly.
If there there is an error in the application the input and the output from the two iterations of the source code would be different.
Implying the Pretty Printer is breaking the \acrshort{ast}.
