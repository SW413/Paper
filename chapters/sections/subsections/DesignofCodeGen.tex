\subsubsection*{The Codegenerator Visitor}
When the code generator is called from the \texttt{main()} class, uses the \acrshort{ast} to accept a \texttt{CodeGeneratorVisitor} as seen on \myref{fig:CodeGeneratorVisitor}.

The visitor builds a string by traversing the nodes of the tree.
Simpler visit methods like a visit method for a \texttt{ConstantExpressionNode} returns a string.
The string is then used in other visit methods e.g. \texttt{AssignmentNode} which then creates a string which is a statement that can be executed in C.
This string from \texttt{AssignmentNode} is then appended to the string, which will contain the outputcode for the \gls{gamble} program when all the nodes from the decorated \acrshort{ast} has been visited.

This means that the information bubbles upwards from the leafs to the statementnodes.
The information ends up in the correct statementnodes  because the visitor pattern makes it possible to specify the route of traversal.
The \texttt{CodeGeneratorVisitor} also contains other methods for making certain C constructions from the \acrshort{ast} which can also be seen on \myref{fig:CodeGeneratorVisitor}. 
When the string is complete it is printed into a file called code.c, along with all the other files needed for running the code, e.g. the kernels used for performing computations on the \acrshort{gpu}.
