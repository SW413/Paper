\chapter{Code Generation}
Code generation is the phase in which the object code is generated, the process and considerations this entails are covered in this chapter.
Object code is the output of the compiler.
Once the source code has passed through syntax analysis and contextual analysis without errors it has been validated and the compiler can proceed with generating the object code.
In the case of this compiler the object code is OpenCL C, as a result one or multiple compilers beyond this one are required to eventually end up with machine code that can be executed.
The object code is OpenCL C this means that tasks such as instruction selection and scheduling as well as register allocation will be handled by the compiler which will compile the OpenCL C code rather than \gls{gamble}.

A state diagram showing the sub-phases of the code generation can be seen in \myref{fig:flowCodegen}.
