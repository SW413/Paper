\section{Syntax Analysis}\label{sec:syntaxAnalysis}
In the syntax analysis part of the compiler the parse tree is built.
The programmer supplies some source code and this part of the compiler turns that into a parse tree.
The process of parsing can be broken into two stages, these stages are similar to how the human brain reads languages.
The brain does not read a sentence character by character, instead we see a stream of words this is because the brain subconsciously groups together characters to form words.
First the source code is a stream of symbols, this stream is then turned into appropriate tokens through lexical analysis.
The scanner or lexer, which turns source code into tokens.
The second stage of the parser is the actual parser.
The parser is fed a stream of tokens to recognise and in turn outputs a parse tree.
