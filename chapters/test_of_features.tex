\chapter{Test of Language Features}
\label{cha:test_of_language_features}
In this chapter \gls{gamble} and the compiler developed for it, will be tested.
The focus of this test will be to test how the compiler reacts to invalid input, both syntactic and contextual.
Also to test if simple operations act as intended and documented in \myref{cha:semantics}. 
As written in our success criteria, \myref{sec:OurCriterias}, it is important to give descriptive error messages, and provide type and scope checking. 

These tests will be performed by using the source code listed in each example as an input for the compiler. 
Then the output from the compiler will be written below the code.
