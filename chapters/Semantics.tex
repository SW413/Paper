\Section{Semantics in the paper}
In this section the semantics for \ancshort{gamble} will be shown and explained.
There exist two way of showing structural operational semantics for a language.
Big-step semantics and small-step semantics, it is deiced to use big-step semantics.
The semantics is organized as follow:

\begin{align*}
	a = arithmetic expression\\
	v = variable\\
	m = Matrix\\
	vec = vector\\
\end{align*}

The v = variable is meant to store the result, this can be both a value, a vector or a matrix.
Every Big-Step semantic showing operations on a matrix, is also possible to person on a vector, which evaluate to a one-dimension matrix.
Every big-step semantic show operations on a vector can not be used on a matrix, since it requires the detentions to fit those of a one-dimension vector.

A matrix is referred to as seen below, the raised number is referred to as the index, where the lowered number is the size of the matrix.
\begin{bmatrix} { { a }_{ 1,2 }^{ 1,1 } } & . & . & . & { a }_{ 1 }^{ n } \\ . & . &  &  &  \\ . &  & . &  &  \\ . &  &  & . &  \\ { a }_{ 2 }^{ n } &  &  &  & { a }_{ 1,2 }^{ n } \end{bmatrix}
