\chapter{Contextual Analysis}
Once the source code has passed through the syntax analysis, and thereby is validated in regard to the \acrshort{cfg}, it must be checked for contextual errors.
In the contextual analysis phase semantic errors are the ones being checked for, this includes type errors such as type mismatch, e.g. adding a boolean to a float, which may well be using the correct grammar, but is not a valid arithmetic expression.
In the contextual analysis there is also checked in which scopes the different variables is available and if there is errors of this type.
The design and implementation of the contextual analysis as well as how such errors are handled are described in this chapter.

The contextual analysis phase has sub-phases for scope- and type-checking and error handling.
An illustration of the design for this can be seen on \myref{fig:flowContextual}

\section{Scope Checking}
As a part of the contextual analysis the compiler must ensure that every reference is valid in their given scope.
The validity of such reference is specific to the rules of the language, this section describes how the compiler upholds the rules listed in \myref{subsec:Scope}.
