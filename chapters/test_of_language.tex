\chapter{Tests of \gls{gamble} and the Compiler} % (fold)
In this chapter \gls{gamble} and the compiler developed for it, will be tested.
It consists of two tests, one to test how the compiler reacts to valid and invalid input, and also to test if the operations in \gls{gamble} work as intended.
The paper will only contain some of the tests performed for checking the validity of \gls{gamble} and the compiler.
The other test will test the run-time efficiency of programs written in \gls{gamble}.
