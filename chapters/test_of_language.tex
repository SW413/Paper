\chapter{Tests of \gls{gamble and the Compiler} % (fold)
In this chapter \gls{gamble} and the compiler developed for it, will be tested.
It consists of two tests, one to test how the compiler reacts to valid and invalid input, and also to test if some of the operations in \gls{gamble} work as inteded. \todo{Some.. burde vi ikke teste dem alle :) ? - SÃ¸ren}
The other test will test the run-time efficiency of programs written in \gls{gamble}.
