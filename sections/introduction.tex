Before the computer mathematical computations were done by hand which was a tiresome and error-prone process.
In modern times computers have become the main target for doing extensive computations, and their Central Processing Units(CPUs) are what the majority of programming languages apply to.
The CPU architecture is designed to efficiently handle sequential instructions and modern compilers can even exploit the CPUs multiple cores in order to attend to serial and task parallel workloads.
As applications and computations grow larger and more complex, programmers and mathematicians find themselves in need of more and more computation power.\citep[pp. 4]{OpenCL_AMD}
At the moment this demand is met with faster multi-cored CPUs however Moore's law, which predicts an exponential growth in transistor count in and integrated circuit thus resulting in faster computations on said CPUs, might come to an end.
A former engineer from Intel foresees this stagnation of Moore's Law as soon as 2020 or 2022; hence alternatives to using the CPU architecture needs to be explored. \citep{Moore2013}

One of these options is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which mainly is used to generate the graphics that are displayed on the screen.
The GPU is specialised in performing a vast number of smaller computations in parallel.
Because of this specialisation, the GPU can handle data parallel workloads just as the CPU can handle task parallel workloads.
Mathematicians and programmers alike can utilise this advantage and hereby complete compute intensive computations on big sets of data in parallel with better performance than on a CPU, assuming these computations can be executed in parallel.
The concept of executing computations on the GPU not related to graphics, is commonly know as General-purpose computing on graphics processing units(GPGPU).

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do GPUs do these parallel calculations, and why and when is it better at it than the CPU?
	\item How can a one utilise the functionality found in the GPU, and what problems must be considered when doing so? 
\end{itemize}

The following sections will go into further detail regarding both the hard- and software used to achieve the performance the GPU offers.
Furthermore it will be described how one can utilise the GPU for its increased computing power, and the different opportunities for doing so.
