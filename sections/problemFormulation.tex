\section{Problem statement}

Linear algebra calculations when sufficiently large can take a long time to compute sequentially. 
Therefore it is smarter to parallelise these computations, and even better to do so on a GPU compared to a CPU, due to its internal architecture.
Linear algebra calculations can be parallelised since none of the calculations done in for example multiplying two matrices, depend on previous calculations.
Therefore the computation time of these calculations can be significantly improved using the parallel computing capabilities on the GPU, giving the matrices are of sufficient size.

Writing programs which can be run on a GPU, can be time consuming using the languages found in \ref{sec:state_of_the_art}.
It is time consuming due to the difficulty of writing code in some of these languages like OpenCL C, and CUDA C.
Therefore we believe that more abstraction and less boilerplate when writing code to the GPU would serve well and reduce the workload on the people programming for the GPU.
In the rest of this paper, the following problem will be thoroughly investigated, not only in the design of the syntax and the semantics of the language, but also in the design of the compiler.
