\section{Problem Formulation}

Linear algebra calculations when sufficiently large can take a long time to compute sequentially. 
Therefore it is smarter to parallelize these computations, and even better to do so on a GPU compared to a CPU, due to its internal architecture, described in \todo{GPU label}.

Writing programs which can be run on a GPU, can be very time consuming using the languages found in \todo{SOTA kilde}.
It is time consuming because of the difficulty writing in some of these languages like OpenCL C, and CUDA.
Therefore we believe that more abstraction of writing to the GPU would serve well and reduce the workload on the programmer.
