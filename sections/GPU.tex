\section{Graphics Processing Units}
Dedicated Graphic Processsing Units (``GPUs'') are very common in desktop and laptops. \citep{STEAMHW}
GPUs are commonly used in the private and professional world, for computer gaming and accelerating graphic intensive programs such as Adobe Photoshop and 3D modeling tools. \citep{NVIDIAADOBE}
Their architecture can also be used for certain types of computations, primarily computations which can be done in parallel.

A basic layout comparison of a Central Processing Unit (``CPU'') and a GPU is shown in \myref{image:GPUCPUimage}.
In the GPU there are many less powerful cores, however the total computation capacity is higher. 
As of Q1 2015 an example of a modern high end desktop CPU is the Intel Haswell core i7 5960X which has a theoretical peak of 384 giga- floating operations pr. secound (GFLOPS) over 8 cores. \citep{puget}
A contemporary high end GPU is the NVIDIA GTX 980 which has 4616 GFLOPS, for single precision with 2048 Shading Units. \citep{techpowerup}
This results in the GPU having 12 times more FLOPS, meaning that it can process more data. 

This makes a GPU an obvious target for computation, even some which are not graphical. % Antagende/konkluderende?!?
