\chapter{GPU overhead}
\label{app:gpuoverhead}
To reach an approximation for when a GPU can run a program faster than a CPU  we wrote two equlient programs.
The first with C as sourcecode and the second as a C sourcecode with CUDA libraries to preform calculations on the GPU.

The source of the two programs can be found on
